Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline: Problem Formulation

1. Business Problem Definition
Customer churn occurs when an existing customer discontinues using a company’s services or purchasing its products. This results in revenue loss and increased costs associated with acquiring new customers. Addressable churn, where intervention can reduce customer attrition, is the focus of this project.
Key Challenges:
•	Loss of revenue due to departing customers.
•	High costs of acquiring new customers.
•	Competitors gaining market share from churned customers.

2. Business Objectives
•	Reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers.
•	Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
•	Improve revenue stability by enhancing customer retention efforts.
•	Automate the end-to-end data processing pipeline for efficiency and scalability.

3. Data Sources
The pipeline will process data from multiple sources, including:
•	Transactional Data(CSV Files): Purchase history, subscription renewals, payment details.
Data Attributes:
•	Customer Profile: customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
•	Transaction Data: Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
•	Usage Metrics: tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies
•	Customer Support Interactions: TechSupport, OnlineSecurity
•	Target Variable: Churn

4. Expected Pipeline Outputs
The pipeline will generate the following outputs:
    1.	Clean Datasets for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    o	Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
    o	Standardize data formats and perform outlier detection.
    2.	Transformed Features for Machine Learning
    o	Feature engineering (e.g., aggregating usage data, creating behavioural scores).
    o	Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.
    o	Generating derived features such as churn likelihood scores.
    3.	Deployable Machine Learning Model
    o	Train and validate a predictive model using historical data.
    o	Integrate with the company’s analytics platform for real-time churn prediction.

5. Evaluation Metrics
To measure the effectiveness of the model and pipeline, we will track:
•	Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted churn cases.
•	Precision & Recall: Balance between false positives and false negatives.
•	F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
•	AUC-ROC Score: Ability of the model to distinguish between churn and non-churn.
•	Business Impact Metrics: Revenue saved through retention strategies.
